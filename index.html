      <p>
        Data is a collection of facts and figures. The data collection was increasing day to day and they needed to be
        stored in a device or a software which is safer.

          Charles Bachman was the first person to develop the Integrated Data Store (IDS) which was based on network
          data model for which he was inaugurated with the Turing Award (The most prestigious award which is equivalent
          to Nobel prize in the field of Computer Science.). It was developed in early 1960’s.

          In the late 1960’s, IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) developed the Integrated Management
          Systems which is the standard database system used till date in many places. It was developed based on the
          hierarchical database model. It was during the year 1970 that the relational database model was developed by
          Edgar Codd. Many of the database models we use today are relational based. It was considered the standardized
          database model from then.

          The relational model was still in use by many people in the market.Later during the same decade (1980’s), IBM
          developed the Structured Query Language (SQL) as a part of R project. It was declared as a standard language
          for the queries by ISO and ANSI. The Transaction Management Systems for processing transactions was also
          developed by James Gray for which he was felicitated the Turing Award.

          Further, there were many other models with rich features like complex queries, datatypes to insert images and
          many others. The Internet Age has perhaps influenced the data models much more. Data models were developed
          using object oriented programming features, embedding with scripting languages like Hyper Text Markup Language
          (HTML) for queries. With humongous data being available online, DBMS is gaining more significance day by day.


          <br>
          <b>Database </b> is a collection of related data and data is a collection of facts and figures that can be
          processed
          to produce information.
          <br>
          Mostly data represents recordable facts. Data aids in producing information, which is based on facts. For
          example, if we have data about marks obtained by all students, we can then conclude about toppers and average
          marks.
          <br>
          <b>A Database Management </b> system stores data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve, manipulate,
          and
          produce information.
          <br><br>

          <b class="red"> CHARACTERISTICS</b><br><br>
          Traditionally, data was organized in file formats. DBMS was a new concept then, and all the research was done
          to make it overcome the deficiencies in traditional style of data management. A modern DBMS has the following
          characteristics <br><br>

          <b>0. Real-world entity</b><br>  A modern DBMS is more realistic and uses real-world entities to design its architecture.
          It uses the behavior and attributes too. For example, a school database may use students as an entity and
          their age as an attribute.<br>

          <b>1. Relation-based tables</b>><br>  DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables. A user can understand
          the architecture of a database just by looking at the table names.<br>

          <b>2.Isolation of data and application</b><br>  A database system is entirely different than its data. A database is an
          active entity, whereas data is said to be passive, on which the database works and organizes. DBMS also stores
          metadata, which is data about data, to ease its own process.<br>

          <b>3.Less redundancy</b><br>  DBMS follows the rules of normalization, which splits a relation when any of its attributes
          is having redundancy in values. Normalization is a mathematically rich and scientific process that reduces
          data redundancy.<br>

          <b>4.Consistency</b> <br> Consistency is a state where every relation in a database remains consistent. There exist
          methods and techniques, which can detect attempt of leaving database in inconsistent state. A DBMS can provide
          greater consistency as compared to earlier forms of data storing applications like file-processing systems.<br>

          <b>5.Query Language</b><br>  DBMS is equipped with query language, which makes it more efficient to retrieve and
          manipulate data. A user can apply as many and as different filtering options as required to retrieve a set of
          data. Traditionally it was not possible where file-processing system was used.<br>

          <b>6.ACID Properties</b> <br> DBMS follows the concepts of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (normally
          shortened as ACID). These concepts are applied on transactions, which manipulate data in a database. ACID
          properties help the database stay healthy in multi-transactional environments and in case of failure.<br>

          <b>7.Multiuser and Concurrent Access</b><br>  DBMS supports multi-user environment and allows them to access and
          manipulate data in parallel. Though there are restrictions on transactions when users attempt to handle the
          same data item, but users are always unaware of them.<br>

          <b>8.Multiple views</b><br>  DBMS offers multiple views for different users. A user who is in the Sales department will
          have a different view of database than a person working in the Production department. This feature enables the
          users to have a concentrate view of the database according to their requirements.<br>

          <b>9.Security</b><br>  Features like multiple views offer security to some extent where users are unable to access data of
          other users and departments. DBMS offers methods to impose constraints while entering data into the database
          and retrieving the same at a later stage. DBMS offers many different levels of security features, which
          enables multiple users to have different views with different features. For example, a user in the Sales
          department cannot see the data that belongs to the Purchase department. Additionally, it can also be managed
          how much data of the Sales department should be displayed to the user. Since a DBMS is not saved on the disk
          as traditional file systems, it is very hard for miscreants to break the code.<br>
