      <p>
        Data is a collection of facts and figures. The data collection was increasing day to day and they needed to be
        stored in a device or a software which is safer.
        <span class="dots">...</span>
        <span class="more" style="display: none;">
          Charles Bachman was the first person to develop the Integrated Data Store (IDS) which was based on network
          data model for which he was inaugurated with the Turing Award (The most prestigious award which is equivalent
          to Nobel prize in the field of Computer Science.). It was developed in early 1960’s.

          In the late 1960’s, IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) developed the Integrated Management
          Systems which is the standard database system used till date in many places. It was developed based on the
          hierarchical database model. It was during the year 1970 that the relational database model was developed by
          Edgar Codd. Many of the database models we use today are relational based. It was considered the standardized
          database model from then.

          The relational model was still in use by many people in the market.Later during the same decade (1980’s), IBM
          developed the Structured Query Language (SQL) as a part of R project. It was declared as a standard language
          for the queries by ISO and ANSI. The Transaction Management Systems for processing transactions was also
          developed by James Gray for which he was felicitated the Turing Award.

          Further, there were many other models with rich features like complex queries, datatypes to insert images and
          many others. The Internet Age has perhaps influenced the data models much more. Data models were developed
          using object oriented programming features, embedding with scripting languages like Hyper Text Markup Language
          (HTML) for queries. With humongous data being available online, DBMS is gaining more significance day by day.


          <br>
          <b>Database </b> is a collection of related data and data is a collection of facts and figures that can be
          processed
          to produce information.
          <br>
          Mostly data represents recordable facts. Data aids in producing information, which is based on facts. For
          example, if we have data about marks obtained by all students, we can then conclude about toppers and average
          marks.
          <br>
          <b>A Database Management </b> system stores data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve, manipulate,
          and
          produce information.
          <br><br>

          <b class="red"> CHARACTERISTICS</b><br><br>
          Traditionally, data was organized in file formats. DBMS was a new concept then, and all the research was done
          to make it overcome the deficiencies in traditional style of data management. A modern DBMS has the following
          characteristics <br><br>

          <b>1. Real-world entity</b><br> A modern DBMS is more realistic and uses real-world entities to design its
          architecture.
          It uses the behavior and attributes too. For example, a school database may use students as an entity and
          their age as an attribute.<br>

          <b>2. Relation-based tables</b><br> DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables. A user can
          understand
          the architecture of a database just by looking at the table names.<br>

          <b>3.Isolation of data and application</b><br> A database system is entirely different than its data. A
          database is an
          active entity, whereas data is said to be passive, on which the database works and organizes. DBMS also stores
          metadata, which is data about data, to ease its own process.<br>

          <b>4.Less redundancy</b><br> DBMS follows the rules of normalization, which splits a relation when any of its
          attributes
          is having redundancy in values. Normalization is a mathematically rich and scientific process that reduces
          data redundancy.<br>

          <b>5.Consistency</b> <br> Consistency is a state where every relation in a database remains consistent. There
          exist
          methods and techniques, which can detect attempt of leaving database in inconsistent state. A DBMS can provide
          greater consistency as compared to earlier forms of data storing applications like file-processing
          systems.<br>

          <b>6.Query Language</b><br> DBMS is equipped with query language, which makes it more efficient to retrieve
          and
          manipulate data. A user can apply as many and as different filtering options as required to retrieve a set of
          data. Traditionally it was not possible where file-processing system was used.<br>

          <b>7.ACID Properties</b> <br> DBMS follows the concepts of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
          (normally
          shortened as ACID). These concepts are applied on transactions, which manipulate data in a database. ACID
          properties help the database stay healthy in multi-transactional environments and in case of failure.<br>

          <b>8.Multiuser and Concurrent Access</b><br> DBMS supports multi-user environment and allows them to access
          and
          manipulate data in parallel. Though there are restrictions on transactions when users attempt to handle the
          same data item, but users are always unaware of them.<br>

          <b>9.Multiple views</b><br> DBMS offers multiple views for different users. A user who is in the Sales
          department will
          have a different view of database than a person working in the Production department. This feature enables the
          users to have a concentrate view of the database according to their requirements.<br>

          <b>10.Security</b><br> Features like multiple views offer security to some extent where users are unable to
          access data of
          other users and departments. DBMS offers methods to impose constraints while entering data into the database
          and retrieving the same at a later stage. DBMS offers many different levels of security features, which
          enables multiple users to have different views with different features. For example, a user in the Sales
          department cannot see the data that belongs to the Purchase department. Additionally, it can also be managed
          how much data of the Sales department should be displayed to the user. Since a DBMS is not saved on the disk
          as traditional file systems, it is very hard for miscreants to break the code.<br><br>


          <b class="red">USERS</b><br><br>
          A typical DBMS has users with different rights and permissions who use it for different purposes. Some users
          retrieve data and some back it up. The users of a DBMS can be broadly categorized as follows<br><br>
          <img src="assets/images/dbms_users.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"><br><br>

          <b>1.Administrators</b> <br> Administrators maintain the DBMS and are responsible for administrating the
          database. They
          are responsible to look after its usage and by whom it should be used. They create access profiles for users
          and apply limitations to maintain isolation and force security. Administrators also look after DBMS resources
          like system license, required tools, and other software and hardware related maintenance.<br>

          <b>2.Designers</b> <br> Designers are the group of people who actually work on the designing part of the
          database. They
          keep a close watch on what data should be kept and in what format. They identify and design the whole set of
          entities, relations, constraints, and views.<br>

          <b>3.End Users</b> <br> End users are those who actually reap the benefits of having a DBMS. End users can
          range from
          simple viewers who pay attention to the logs or market rates to sophisticated users such as business
          analysts.<br><br>

          <b class="red">ARCHITECTURE</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The
          architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier. An n-tier architecture divides the
          whole system into related but independent n modules, which can be independently modified, altered, changed, or
          replaced.<br>

          In 1-tier architecture, the DBMS is the only entity where the user directly sits on the DBMS and uses it. Any
          changes done here will directly be done on the DBMS itself. It does not provide handy tools for end-users.
          Database designers and programmers normally prefer to use single-tier architecture.<br>

          If the architecture of DBMS is 2-tier, then it must have an application through which the DBMS can be
          accessed. Programmers use 2-tier architecture where they access the DBMS by means of an application. Here the
          application tier is entirely independent of the database in terms of operation, design, and
          programming.<br><br>

          <b class="blue">3 TIER ARCHITECTURE</b><br>
          A 3-tier architecture separates its tiers from each other based on the complexity of the users and how they
          use the data present in the database. It is the most widely used architecture to design a DBMS.
          <br><br>


          <img src="assets/images/dbms_architecture.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"><br><br>

          <b>1.Database (Data) Tier </b><br> At this tier, the database resides along with its query processing
          languages. We also
          have the relations that define the data and their constraints at this level.<br>

          <b>2.Application (Middle) Tier </b><br> At this tier reside the application server and the programs that
          access the
          database. For a user, this application tier presents an abstracted view of the database. End-users are unaware
          of any existence of the database beyond the application. At the other end, the database tier is not aware of
          any other user beyond the application tier. Hence, the application layer sits in the middle and acts as a
          mediator between the end-user and the database.<br>

          <b>3.User (Presentation) Tier </b><br> End-users operate on this tier and they know nothing about any
          existence of the
          database beyond this layer. At this layer, multiple views of the database can be provided by the application.
          All views are generated by applications that reside in the application tier.<br><br>

          Multiple-tier database architecture is highly modifiable, as almost all its components are independent and can
          be changed independently.<br><br>

          <b class="red">DATA MODELS</b><br><br>
          Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled. Data Models are fundamental entities to
          introduce abstraction in a DBMS. Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are
          processed and stored inside the system.<br>

          The very first data model could be flat data-models, where all the data used are to be kept in the same plane.
          Earlier data models were not so scientific, hence they were prone to introduce lots of duplication and update
          anomalies<br><br>

          <b class="blue">
            Entity-Relationship Model
          </b>
          <br>
          Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is based on the notion of real-world entities and relationships among them.
          While formulating real-world scenario into the database model, the ER Model creates entity set, relationship
          set, general attributes and constraints.<br>

          ER Model is best used for the conceptual design of a database.<br>

          ER Model is based on<br><br>

          1.Entities and their attributes.<br>

          2.Relationships among entities.<br><br>


          <img src="assets/images/er_model_intro.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"><br><br>

          <b>1.Entity</b> <br> An entity in an ER Model is a real-world entity having properties called attributes.
          Every attribute
          is defined by its set of values called domain. For example, in a school database, a student is considered as
          an entity. Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc.<br>

          <b>2.Relationship</b> <br> The logical association among entities is called relationship. Relationships are
          mapped with
          entities in various ways. Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities.<br><br>

          Mapping cardinalities <br><br>

          1.one to one<br>
          2.one to many<br>
          3.many to one<br>
          4.many to many<br><br>
          <b class="blue">Relational Model</b><br>
          The most popular data model in DBMS is the Relational Model. It is more scientific a model than others. This
          model is based on first-order predicate logic and defines a table as an n-ary relation.<br><br>

          <img src="assets/images/relational_model_table.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"><br><br>

          The main highlights of this model are <br><br>

          Data is stored in tables called relations.<br>
          Relations can be normalized.<br>
          In normalized relations, values saved are atomic values.<br>
          Each row in a relation contains a unique value.<br>
          Each column in a relation contains values from a same domain.<br>
